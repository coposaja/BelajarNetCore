# Host and deploy Blazor server-side

By [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex), [Rainer Stropek](https://www.timecockpit.com), and [Daniel Roth](https://github.com/danroth27)

## Host configuration values

Server-side apps that use the [server-side hosting model](xref:blazor/hosting-models#server-side) can accept [Generic Host configuration values](xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host#host-configuration).

## Deployment

With the [server-side hosting model](xref:blazor/hosting-models#server-side), Blazor is executed on the server from within an ASP.NET Core app. UI updates, event handling, and JavaScript calls are handled over a [SignalR](xref:signalr/introduction) connection.

A web server capable of hosting an ASP.NET Core app is required. Visual Studio includes the **Blazor Server App** project template (`blazorserverside` template when using the [dotnet new](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command).

## Connection scale out

Blazor server-side apps require one active SignalR connection for each user. A production Blazor server-side deployment requires a solution for supporting as many concurrent connections as required by the app. The [Azure SignalR Service](/azure/azure-signalr/) handles the scaling of connections and is recommended as a scaling solution for Blazor server-side apps. For more information, see <xref:signalr/publish-to-azure-web-app>.

## SignalR configuration

SignalR is configured by ASP.NET Core for the most common Blazor server-side scenarios. For custom and advanced scenarios, consult the SignalR articles in the [Additional resources](#additional-resources) section.
