# Integration tests in ASP.NET Core

By [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex) and [Steve Smith](https://ardalis.com/)

Integration tests ensure that an app's components function correctly at a level that includes the app's supporting infrastructure, such as the database, file system, and network. ASP.NET Core supports integration tests using a unit test framework with a test web host and an in-memory test server.

This topic assumes a basic understanding of unit tests. If unfamiliar with test concepts, see the [Unit Testing in .NET Core and .NET Standard](/dotnet/core/testing/) topic and its linked content.

The sample app is a Razor Pages app and assumes a basic understanding of Razor Pages. If unfamiliar with Razor Pages, see the following topics:

* [Introduction to Razor Pages](xref:razor-pages/index)
* [Get started with Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start)
* [Razor Pages unit tests](xref:test/razor-pages-tests)

> [!NOTE]
> For testing SPAs, we recommended a tool such as [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/), which can automate a browser.

## Introduction to integration tests

Integration tests evaluate an app's components on a broader level than [unit tests](/dotnet/core/testing/). Unit tests are used to test isolated software components, such as individual class methods. Integration tests confirm that two or more app components work together to produce an expected result, possibly including every component required to fully process a request.

These broader tests are used to test the app's infrastructure and whole framework, often including the following components:

* Database
* File system
* Network appliances
* Request-response pipeline

Unit tests use fabricated components, known as *fakes* or *mock objects*, in place of infrastructure components.

In contrast to unit tests, integration tests:

* Use the actual components that the app uses in production.
* Require more code and data processing.
* Take longer to run.

Therefore, limit the use of integration tests to the most important infrastructure scenarios. If a behavior can be tested using either a unit test or an integration test, choose the unit test.

> [!TIP]
> Don't write integration tests for every possible permutation of data and file access with databases and file systems. Regardless of how many places across an app interact with databases and file systems, a focused set of read, write, update, and delete integration tests are usually capable of adequately testing database and file system components. Use unit tests for routine tests of method logic that interact with these components. In unit tests, the use of infrastructure fakes/mocks result in faster test execution.

> [!NOTE]
> In discussions of integration tests, the tested project is frequently called the *system under test*, or "SUT" for short.

## ASP.NET Core integration tests

Integration tests in ASP.NET Core require the following:

* A test project is used to contain and execute the tests. The test project has a reference to the tested ASP.NET Core project, called the *system under test* (SUT). _"SUT" is used throughout this topic to refer to the tested app._
* The test project creates a test web host for the SUT and uses a test server client to handle requests and responses to the SUT.
* A test runner is used to execute the tests and report the test results.

Integration tests follow a sequence of events that include the usual *Arrange*, *Act*, and *Assert* test steps:

1. The SUT's web host is configured.
1. A test server client is created to submit requests to the app.
1. The *Arrange* test step is executed: The test app prepares a request.
1. The *Act* test step is executed: The client submits the request and receives the response.
1. The *Assert* test step is executed: The *actual* response is validated as a *pass* or *fail* based on an *expected* response.
1. The process continues until all of the tests are executed.
1. The test results are reported.

Usually, the test web host is configured differently than the app's normal web host for the test runs. For example, a different database or different app settings might be used for the tests.

Infrastructure components, such as the test web host and in-memory test server ([TestServer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost.testserver)), are provided or managed by the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing) package. Use of this package streamlines test creation and execution.

The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` package handles the following tasks:

* Copies the dependencies file (*\*.deps*) from the SUT into the test project's *bin* directory.
* Sets the content root to the SUT's project root so that static files and pages/views are found when the tests are executed.
* Provides the [WebApplicationFactory](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1) class to streamline bootstrapping the SUT with `TestServer`.

The [unit tests](/dotnet/articles/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test) documentation describes how to set up a test project and test runner, along with detailed instructions on how to run tests and recommendations for how to name tests and test classes.

> [!NOTE]
> When creating a test project for an app, separate the unit tests from the integration tests into different projects. This helps ensure that infrastructure testing components aren't accidentally included in the unit tests. Separation of unit and integration tests also allows control over which set of tests are run.

There's virtually no difference between the configuration for tests of Razor Pages apps and MVC apps. The only difference is in how the tests are named. In a Razor Pages app, tests of page endpoints are usually named after the page model class (for example, `IndexPageTests` to test component integration for the Index page). In an MVC app, tests are usually organized by controller classes and named after the controllers they test (for example, `HomeControllerTests` to test component integration for the Home controller).

## Test app prerequisites

The test project must:

* Reference the following packages:
  * [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App/)
  * [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing/)
* Specify the Web SDK in the project file (`<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">`). The Web SDK is required when referencing the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage-app).

These prerequisites can be seen in the [sample app](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/test/integration-tests/samples/). Inspect the *tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests.csproj* file. The sample app uses the [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) test framework and the [AngleSharp](https://anglesharp.github.io/) parser library, so the sample app also references:

* [xunit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit/)
* [xunit.runner.visualstudio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit.runner.visualstudio/)
* [AngleSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngleSharp/)

## SUT environment

If the SUT's [environment](xref:fundamentals/environments) isn't set, the environment defaults to Development.

## Basic tests with the default WebApplicationFactory

[WebApplicationFactory&lt;TEntryPoint&gt;](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1) is used to create a [TestServer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost.testserver) for the integration tests. `TEntryPoint` is the entry point class of the SUT, usually the `Startup` class.

Test classes implement a *class fixture* interface ([IClassFixture](https://xunit.github.io/docs/shared-context#class-fixture)) to indicate the class contains tests and provide shared object instances across the tests in the class.

### Basic test of app endpoints

The following test class, `BasicTests`, uses the `WebApplicationFactory` to bootstrap the SUT and provide an [HttpClient](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) to a test method, `Get_EndpointsReturnSuccessAndCorrectContentType`. The method checks if the response status code is successful (status codes in the range 200-299) and the `Content-Type` header is `text/html; charset=utf-8` for several app pages.

[CreateClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1.createclient) creates an instance of `HttpClient` that automatically follows redirects and handles cookies.

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/IntegrationTests/BasicTests.cs?name=snippet1)]

By default, non-essential cookies aren't preserved across requests when the [GDPR consent policy](xref:security/gdpr) is enabled. To preserve non-essential cookies, such as those used by the TempData provider, mark them as essential in your tests. For instructions on marking a cookie as essential, see [Essential cookies](xref:security/gdpr#essential-cookies).

### Test a secure endpoint

Another test in the `BasicTests` class checks that a secure endpoint redirects an unauthenticated user to the app's Login page.

In the SUT, the `/SecurePage` page uses an [AuthorizePage](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.pageconventioncollectionextensions.authorizepage) convention to apply an [AuthorizeFilter](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.authorization.authorizefilter) to the page. For more information, see [Razor Pages authorization conventions](xref:security/authorization/razor-pages-authorization#require-authorization-to-access-a-page).

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/src/RazorPagesProject/Startup.cs?name=snippet1)]

In the `Get_SecurePageRequiresAnAuthenticatedUser` test, a [WebApplicationFactoryClientOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactoryclientoptions) is set to disallow redirects by setting [AllowAutoRedirect](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactoryclientoptions.allowautoredirect) to `false`:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/IntegrationTests/BasicTests.cs?name=snippet2)]

By disallowing the client to follow the redirect, the following checks can be made:

* The status code returned by the SUT can be checked against the expected [HttpStatusCode.Redirect](/dotnet/api/system.net.httpstatuscode) result, not the final status code after the redirect to the Login page, which would be [HttpStatusCode.OK](/dotnet/api/system.net.httpstatuscode).
* The `Location` header value in the response headers is checked to confirm that it starts with `http://localhost/Identity/Account/Login`, not the final Login page response, where the `Location` header wouldn't be present.

For more information on `WebApplicationFactoryClientOptions`, see the [Client options](#client-options) section.

## Customize WebApplicationFactory

Web host configuration can be created independently of the test classes by inheriting from `WebApplicationFactory` to create one or more custom factories:

1. Inherit from `WebApplicationFactory` and override [ConfigureWebHost](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1.configurewebhost). The [IWebHostBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.iwebhostbuilder) allows the configuration of the service collection with [ConfigureServices](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.istartup.configureservices):

   [!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/CustomWebApplicationFactory.cs?name=snippet1)]

   Database seeding in the [sample app](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/test/integration-tests/samples) is performed by the `InitializeDbForTests` method. The method is described in the [Integration tests sample: Test app organization](#test-app-organization) section.

2. Use the custom `CustomWebApplicationFactory` in test classes. The following example uses the factory in the `IndexPageTests` class:

   [!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/IntegrationTests/IndexPageTests.cs?name=snippet1)]

   The sample app's client is configured to prevent the `HttpClient` from following redirects. As explained in the [Test a secure endpoint](#test-a-secure-endpoint) section, this permits tests to check the result of the app's first response. The first response is a redirect in many of these tests with a `Location` header.

3. A typical test uses the `HttpClient` and helper methods to process the request and the response:

   [!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/IntegrationTests/IndexPageTests.cs?name=snippet2)]

Any POST request to the SUT must satisfy the antiforgery check that's automatically made by the app's [data protection antiforgery system](xref:security/data-protection/introduction). In order to arrange for a test's POST request, the test app must:

1. Make a request for the page.
1. Parse the antiforgery cookie and request validation token from the response.
1. Make the POST request with the antiforgery cookie and request validation token in place.

The `SendAsync` helper extension methods (*Helpers/HttpClientExtensions.cs*) and the `GetDocumentAsync` helper method (*Helpers/HtmlHelpers.cs*) in the [sample app](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/test/integration-tests/samples/) use the [AngleSharp](https://anglesharp.github.io/) parser to handle the antiforgery check with the following methods:

* `GetDocumentAsync` &ndash; Receives the [HttpResponseMessage](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpresponsemessage) and returns an `IHtmlDocument`. `GetDocumentAsync` uses a factory that prepares a *virtual response* based on the original `HttpResponseMessage`. For more information, see the [AngleSharp documentation](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp#documentation).
* `SendAsync` extension methods for the `HttpClient` compose an [HttpRequestMessage](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httprequestmessage) and call [SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage)](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient.sendasync#System_Net_Http_HttpClient_SendAsync_System_Net_Http_HttpRequestMessage_) to submit requests to the SUT. Overloads for `SendAsync` accept the HTML form (`IHtmlFormElement`) and the following:
  * Submit button of the form (`IHtmlElement`)
  * Form values collection (`IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, string>>`)
  * Submit button (`IHtmlElement`) and form values (`IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, string>>`)

> [!NOTE]
> [AngleSharp](https://anglesharp.github.io/) is a third-party parsing library used for demonstration purposes in this topic and the sample app. AngleSharp isn't supported or required for integration testing of ASP.NET Core apps. Other parsers can be used, such as the [Html Agility Pack (HAP)](https://html-agility-pack.net/). Another approach is to write code to handle the antiforgery system's request verification token and antiforgery cookie directly.

## Customize the client with WithWebHostBuilder

When additional configuration is required within a test method, [WithWebHostBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1.withwebhostbuilder) creates a new `WebApplicationFactory` with an [IWebHostBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.iwebhostbuilder) that is further customized by configuration.

The `Post_DeleteMessageHandler_ReturnsRedirectToRoot` test method of the [sample app](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/test/integration-tests/samples) demonstrates the use of `WithWebHostBuilder`. This test performs a record delete in the database by triggering a form submission in the SUT.

Because another test in the `IndexPageTests` class performs an operation that deletes all of the records in the database and may run before the `Post_DeleteMessageHandler_ReturnsRedirectToRoot` method, the database is seeded in this test method to ensure that a record is present for the SUT to delete. Selecting the `deleteBtn1` button of the `messages` form in the SUT is simulated in the request to the SUT:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/IntegrationTests/IndexPageTests.cs?name=snippet3)]

## Client options

The following table shows the default [WebApplicationFactoryClientOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactoryclientoptions) available when creating `HttpClient` instances.

| Option | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| [AllowAutoRedirect](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactoryclientoptions.allowautoredirect) | Gets or sets whether or not `HttpClient` instances should automatically follow redirect responses. | `true` |
| [BaseAddress](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactoryclientoptions.baseaddress) | Gets or sets the base address of `HttpClient` instances. | `http://localhost` |
| [HandleCookies](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactoryclientoptions.handlecookies) | Gets or sets whether `HttpClient` instances should handle cookies. | `true` |
| [MaxAutomaticRedirections](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactoryclientoptions.maxautomaticredirections) | Gets or sets the maximum number of redirect responses that `HttpClient` instances should follow. | 7 |

Create the `WebApplicationFactoryClientOptions` class and pass it to the [CreateClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1.createclient) method (default values are shown in the code example):

```csharp
// Default client option values are shown
var clientOptions = new WebApplicationFactoryClientOptions();
clientOptions.AllowAutoRedirect = true;
clientOptions.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost");
clientOptions.HandleCookies = true;
clientOptions.MaxAutomaticRedirections = 7;

_client = _factory.CreateClient(clientOptions);
```

## Inject mock services

Services can be overridden in a test with a call to [ConfigureTestServices](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost.webhostbuilderextensions.configuretestservices) on the host builder. **To inject mock services, the SUT must have a `Startup` class with a `Startup.ConfigureServices` method.**

The sample SUT includes a scoped service that returns a quote. The quote is embedded in a hidden field on the Index page when the Index page is requested.

*Services/IQuoteService.cs*:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/src/RazorPagesProject/Services/IQuoteService.cs?name=snippet1)]

*Services/QuoteService.cs*:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/src/RazorPagesProject/Services/QuoteService.cs?name=snippet1)]

*Startup.cs*:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/src/RazorPagesProject/Startup.cs?name=snippet2)]

*Pages/Index.cshtml.cs*:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/src/RazorPagesProject/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet1&highlight=4,9,20,26)]

*Pages/Index.cs*:

[!code-cshtml[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/src/RazorPagesProject/Pages/Index.cshtml?name=snippet_Quote)]

The following markup is generated when the SUT app is run:

```html
<input id="quote" type="hidden" value="Come on, Sarah. We&#x27;ve an appointment in 
    London, and we&#x27;re already 30,000 years late.">
```

To test the service and quote injection in an integration test, a mock service is injected into the SUT by the test. The mock service replaces the app's `QuoteService` with a service provided by the test app, called `TestQuoteService`:

*IntegrationTests.IndexPageTests.cs*:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/IntegrationTests/IndexPageTests.cs?name=snippet4)]

`ConfigureTestServices` is called, and the scoped service is registered:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/IntegrationTests/IndexPageTests.cs?name=snippet5&highlight=7-10,17,20-21)]

The markup produced during the test's execution reflects the quote text supplied by `TestQuoteService`, thus the assertion passes:

```html
<input id="quote" type="hidden" value="Something&#x27;s interfering with time, 
    Mr. Scarman, and time is my business.">
```

## How the test infrastructure infers the app content root path

The `WebApplicationFactory` constructor infers the app content root path by searching for a [WebApplicationFactoryContentRootAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactorycontentrootattribute) on the assembly containing the integration tests with a key equal to the `TEntryPoint` assembly `System.Reflection.Assembly.FullName`. In case an attribute with the correct key isn't found, `WebApplicationFactory` falls back to searching for a solution file (*\*.sln*) and appends the `TEntryPoint` assembly name to the solution directory. The app root directory (the content root path) is used to discover views and content files.

## Disable shadow copying

Shadow copying causes the tests to execute in a different directory than the output directory. For tests to work properly, shadow copying must be disabled. The [sample app](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/test/integration-tests/samples) uses xUnit and disables shadow copying for xUnit by including an *xunit.runner.json* file with the correct configuration setting. For more information, see [Configuring xUnit with JSON](https://xunit.github.io/docs/configuring-with-json.html).

Add the *xunit.runner.json* file to root of the test project with the following content:

```json
{
  "shadowCopy": false
}
```

## Disposal of objects

After the tests of the `IClassFixture` implementation are executed, [TestServer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost.testserver) and [HttpClient](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) are disposed when xUnit disposes of the [WebApplicationFactory](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1). If objects instantiated by the developer require disposal, dispose of them in the `IClassFixture` implementation. For more information, see [Implementing a Dispose method](/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose).

## Integration tests sample

The [sample app](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/test/integration-tests/samples) is composed of two apps:

| App | Project directory | Description |
| --- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Message app (the SUT) | *src/RazorPagesProject* | Allows a user to add, delete one, delete all, and analyze messages. |
| Test app | *tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests* | Used to integration test the SUT. |

The tests can be run using the built-in test features of an IDE, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). If using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or the command line, execute the following command at a command prompt in the *tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests* directory:

```console
dotnet test
```

### Message app (SUT) organization

The SUT is a Razor Pages message system with the following characteristics:

* The Index page of the app (*Pages/Index.cshtml* and *Pages/Index.cshtml.cs*) provides a UI and page model methods to control the addition, deletion, and analysis of messages (average words per message).
* A message is described by the `Message` class (*Data/Message.cs*) with two properties: `Id` (key) and `Text` (message). The `Text` property is required and limited to 200 characters.
* Messages are stored using [Entity Framework's in-memory database](/ef/core/providers/in-memory/)&#8224;.
* The app contains a data access layer (DAL) in its database context class, `AppDbContext` (*Data/AppDbContext.cs*).
* If the database is empty on app startup, the message store is initialized with three messages.
* The app includes a `/SecurePage` that can only be accessed by an authenticated user.

&#8224;The EF topic, [Test with InMemory](/ef/core/miscellaneous/testing/in-memory), explains how to use an in-memory database for tests with MSTest. This topic uses the [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) test framework. Test concepts and test implementations across different test frameworks are similar but not identical.

Although the app doesn't use the repository pattern and isn't an effective example of the [Unit of Work (UoW) pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html), Razor Pages supports these patterns of development. For more information, see [Designing the infrastructure persistence layer](/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design) and [Test controller logic](/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/testing) (the sample implements the repository pattern).

### Test app organization

The test app is a console app inside the *tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests* directory.

| Test app directory | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| *BasicTests* | *BasicTests.cs* contains test methods for routing, accessing a secure page by an unauthenticated user, and obtaining a GitHub user profile and checking the profile's user login. |
| *IntegrationTests* | *IndexPageTests.cs* contains the integration tests for the Index page using custom `WebApplicationFactory` class. |
| *Helpers/Utilities* | <ul><li>*Utilities.cs* contains the `InitializeDbForTests` method used to seed the database with test data.</li><li>*HtmlHelpers.cs* provides a method to return an AngleSharp `IHtmlDocument` for use by the test methods.</li><li>*HttpClientExtensions.cs* provide overloads for `SendAsync` to submit requests to the SUT.</li></ul> |

The test framework is [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/). Integration tests are conducted using the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost), which includes the [TestServer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost.testserver). Because the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing) package is used to configure the test host and test server, the `TestHost` and `TestServer` packages don't require direct package references in the test app's project file or developer configuration in the test app.

**Seeding the database for testing**

Integration tests usually require a small dataset in the database prior to the test execution. For example, a delete test calls for a database record deletion, so the database must have at least one record for the delete request to succeed.

The sample app seeds the database with three messages in *Utilities.cs* that tests can use when they execute:

[!code-csharp[](integration-tests/samples/2.x/IntegrationTestsSample/tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests/Helpers/Utilities.cs?name=snippet1)]
