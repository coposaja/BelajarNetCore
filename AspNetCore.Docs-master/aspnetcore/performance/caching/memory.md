## Caching basics

Caching can significantly improve the performance and scalability of an app by reducing the work required to generate content. Caching works best with data that changes infrequently. Caching makes a copy of data that can be returned much faster than from the original source. Apps should be written and tested to **never** depend on cached data.

ASP.NET Core supports several different caches. The simplest cache is based on the [IMemoryCache](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.imemorycache), which represents a cache stored in the memory of the web server. Apps that run on a server farm of multiple servers should ensure that sessions are sticky when using the in-memory cache. Sticky sessions ensure that subsequent requests from a client all go to the same server. For example, Azure Web apps use [Application Request Routing](https://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/planning-for-arr) (ARR) to route all subsequent requests to the same server.

Non-sticky sessions in a web farm require a [distributed cache](distributed.md) to avoid cache consistency problems. For some apps, a distributed cache can support higher scale-out than an in-memory cache. Using a distributed cache offloads the cache memory to an external process.

The `IMemoryCache` cache will evict cache entries under memory pressure unless the [cache priority](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheitempriority) is set to `CacheItemPriority.NeverRemove`. You can set the `CacheItemPriority` to adjust the priority with which the cache evicts items under memory pressure.

The in-memory cache can store any object; the distributed cache interface is limited to `byte[]`. The in-memory and distributed cache store cache items as key-value pairs.

## System.Runtime.Caching/MemoryCache

<xref:System.Runtime.Caching>/<xref:System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache> ([NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Runtime.Caching/)) can be used with:

* .NET Standard 2.0 or later.
* Any [.NET implementation](/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support) that targets .NET Standard 2.0 or later. For example, ASP.NET Core 2.0 or later.
* .NET Framework 4.5 or later.

[Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory/)/`IMemoryCache` (described in this article) is recommended over `System.Runtime.Caching`/`MemoryCache` because it's better integrated into ASP.NET Core. For example, `IMemoryCache` works natively with ASP.NET Core [dependency injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection).

Use `System.Runtime.Caching`/`MemoryCache` as a compatibility bridge when porting code from ASP.NET 4.x to ASP.NET Core.

## Cache guidelines

* Code should always have a fallback option to fetch data and **not** depend on a cached value being available.
* The cache uses a scarce resource, memory. Limit cache growth:
  * Do **not** use external input as cache keys.
  * Use expirations to limit cache growth.
  * [Use SetSize, Size, and SizeLimit to limit cache size](#use-setsize-size-and-sizelimit-to-limit-cache-size). The ASP.NET Core runtime does not limit cache size based on memory pressure. It's up to the developer to limit cache size.

## Using IMemoryCache

In-memory caching is a *service* that's referenced from your app using [Dependency Injection](../../fundamentals/dependency-injection.md). Call `AddMemoryCache` in `ConfigureServices`:

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/WebCache/Startup.cs?highlight=9)]

Request the `IMemoryCache` instance in the constructor:

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/WebCache/Controllers/HomeController.cs?name=snippet_ctor)]

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.0"

`IMemoryCache` requires NuGet package [Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory/).

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

`IMemoryCache` requires NuGet package [Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory/), which is available in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.All metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage).

The following code uses [TryGetValue](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.imemorycache.trygetvalue?view=aspnetcore-2.0#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_IMemoryCache_TryGetValue_System_Object_System_Object__) to check if a time is in the cache. If a time isn't cached, a new entry is created and added to the cache with [Set](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheextensions.set?view=aspnetcore-2.0#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_CacheExtensions_Set__1_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_IMemoryCache_System_Object___0_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_MemoryCacheEntryOptions_).

[!code-csharp [](memory/sample/WebCache/CacheKeys.cs)]

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/WebCache/Controllers/HomeController.cs?name=snippet1)]

The current time and the cached time are displayed:

[!code-cshtml[](memory/sample/WebCache/Views/Home/Cache.cshtml)]

The cached `DateTime` value remains in the cache while there are requests within the timeout period. The following image shows the current time and an older time retrieved from the cache:

![Index view with two different times displayed](memory/_static/time.png)

The following code uses [GetOrCreate](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheextensions.getorcreate#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_CacheExtensions_GetOrCreate__1_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_IMemoryCache_System_Object_System_Func_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_ICacheEntry___0__) and [GetOrCreateAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheextensions.getorcreateasync#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_CacheExtensions_GetOrCreateAsync__1_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_IMemoryCache_System_Object_System_Func_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_ICacheEntry_System_Threading_Tasks_Task___0___) to cache data.

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/WebCache/Controllers/HomeController.cs?name=snippet2&highlight=3-7,14-19)]

The following code calls [Get](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheextensions.get#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_CacheExtensions_Get__1_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_IMemoryCache_System_Object_) to fetch the cached time:

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/WebCache/Controllers/HomeController.cs?name=snippet_gct)]

<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.CacheExtensions.GetOrCreate*> , <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.CacheExtensions.GetOrCreateAsync*>, and [Get](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheextensions.get#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_CacheExtensions_Get__1_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_IMemoryCache_System_Object_) are extension methods part of the [CacheExtensions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheextensions) class that extends the capability of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.IMemoryCache>. See [IMemoryCache methods](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.imemorycache) and [CacheExtensions methods](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.cacheextensions) for a description of other cache methods.

## MemoryCacheEntryOptions

The following sample:

* Sets the absolute expiration time. This is the maximum time the entry can be cached and prevents the item from becoming too stale when the sliding expiration is continuously renewed.
* Sets a sliding expiration time. Requests that access this cached item will reset the sliding expiration clock.
* Sets the cache priority to `CacheItemPriority.NeverRemove`.
* Sets a [PostEvictionDelegate](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.postevictiondelegate) that will be called after the entry is evicted from the cache. The callback is run on a different thread from the code that removes the item from the cache.

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/WebCache/Controllers/HomeController.cs?name=snippet_et&highlight=14-21)]

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.0"

## Use SetSize, Size, and SizeLimit to limit cache size

A `MemoryCache` instance may optionally specify and enforce a size limit. The memory size limit does not have a defined unit of measure because the cache has no mechanism to measure the size of entries. If the cache memory size limit is set, all entries must specify size. The ASP.NET Core runtime does not limit cache size based on memory pressure. It's up to the developer to limit cache size. The size specified is in units the developer chooses.

For example:

* If the web app was primarily caching strings, each cache entry size could be the string length.
* The app could specify the size of all entries as 1, and the size limit is the count of entries.

The following code creates a unitless fixed size [MemoryCache](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.memorycache?view=aspnetcore-2.1) accessible by [dependency injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection):

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/RPcache/Services/MyMemoryCache.cs?name=snippet)]

[SizeLimit](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.memorycacheoptions.sizelimit?view=aspnetcore-2.1#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_MemoryCacheOptions_SizeLimit) does not have units. Cached entries must specify size in whatever units they deem most appropriate if the cache memory size has been set. All users of a cache instance should use the same unit system. An entry will not be cached if the sum of the cached entry sizes exceeds the value specified by `SizeLimit`. If no cache size limit is set, the cache size set on the entry will be ignored.

The following code registers `MyMemoryCache` with the [dependency injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection) container.

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/RPcache/Startup.cs?name=snippet&highlight=5)]

`MyMemoryCache` is created as an independent memory cache for components that are aware of this size limited cache and know how to set cache entry size appropriately.

The following code uses `MyMemoryCache`:

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/RPcache/Pages/About.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

The size of the cache entry can be set by [Size](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.memorycacheentryoptions.size?view=aspnetcore-2.1#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_MemoryCacheEntryOptions_Size) or the [SetSize](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.memorycacheentryextensions.setsize?view=aspnetcore-2.0#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_MemoryCacheEntryExtensions_SetSize_Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_MemoryCacheEntryOptions_System_Int64_) extension method:

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/RPcache/Pages/About.cshtml.cs?name=snippet2&highlight=9,10,14,15)]

::: moniker-end

## Cache dependencies

The following sample shows how to expire a cache entry if a dependent entry expires. A `CancellationChangeToken` is added to the cached item. When `Cancel` is called on the `CancellationTokenSource`, both cache entries are evicted.

[!code-csharp[](memory/sample/WebCache/Controllers/HomeController.cs?name=snippet_ed)]

Using a `CancellationTokenSource` allows multiple cache entries to be evicted as a group. With the `using` pattern in the code above, cache entries created inside the `using` block will inherit triggers and expiration settings.

## Additional notes

* When using a callback to repopulate a cache item:

  * Multiple requests can find the cached key value empty because the callback hasn't completed.
  * This can result in several threads repopulating the cached item.

* When one cache entry is used to create another, the child copies the parent entry's expiration tokens and time-based expiration settings. The child isn't expired by manual removal or updating of the parent entry.

* Use [PostEvictionCallbacks](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.memory.icacheentry.postevictioncallbacks#Microsoft_Extensions_Caching_Memory_ICacheEntry_PostEvictionCallbacks) to set the callbacks that will be fired after the cache entry is evicted from the cache.
