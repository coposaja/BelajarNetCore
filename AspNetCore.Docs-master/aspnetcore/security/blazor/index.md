# ASP.NET Core Blazor authentication and authorization

By [Steve Sanderson](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS)

ASP.NET Core supports the configuration and management of security in Blazor apps.

Security scenarios differ between Blazor server-side and client-side apps. Because Blazor server-side apps run on the server, authorization checks are able to determine:

* The UI options presented to a user (for example, which menu entries are available to a user).
* Access rules for areas of the app and components.

Blazor client-side apps run on the client. Authorization is *only* used to determine which UI options to show. Since client-side checks can be modified or bypassed by a user, a Blazor client-side app can't enforce authorization access rules.

## Authentication

Blazor uses the existing ASP.NET Core authentication mechanisms to establish the user's identity. The exact mechanism depends on how the Blazor app is hosted, server-side or client-side.

### Blazor server-side authentication

Blazor server-side apps operate over a real-time connection that's created using SignalR. [Authentication in SignalR-based apps](xref:signalr/authn-and-authz) is handled when the connection is established. Authentication can be based on a cookie or some other bearer token.

The Blazor server-side project template can set up authentication for you when the project is created.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

Follow the Visual Studio guidance in the <xref:blazor/get-started> article to create a new Blazor server-side project with an authentication mechanism.

After choosing the **Blazor Server App** template in the **Create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application** dialog, select **Change** under **Authentication**.

A dialog opens to offer the same set of authentication mechanisms available for other ASP.NET Core projects:

* **No Authentication**
* **Individual User Accounts** &ndash; User accounts can be stored:
  * Within the app using ASP.NET Core's [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) system.
  * With [Azure AD B2C](xref:security/authentication/azure-ad-b2c).
* **Work or School Accounts**
* **Windows Authentication**

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

Follow the Visual Studio Code guidance in the <xref:blazor/get-started> article to create a new Blazor server-side project with an authentication mechanism:

```console
dotnet new blazorserverside -o {APP NAME} -au {AUTHENTICATION}
```

Permissible authentication values (`{AUTHENTICATION}`) are shown in the following table.

| Authentication mechanism                                                                 | `{AUTHENTICATION}` value |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------: |
| No Authentication                                                                        | `None`                   |
| Individual<br>Users stored in the app with ASP.NET Core Identity.                        | `Individual`             |
| Individual<br>Users stored in [Azure AD B2C](xref:security/authentication/azure-ad-b2c). | `IndividualB2C`          |
| Work or School Accounts<br>Organizational authentication for a single tenant.            | `SingleOrg`              |
| Work or School Accounts<br>Organizational authentication for multiple tenants.           | `MultiOrg`               |
| Windows Authentication                                                                   | `Windows`                |

The command creates a folder named with the value provided for the `{APP NAME}` placeholder and uses the folder name as the app's name. For more information, see the [dotnet new](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command in the .NET Core Guide.

### Blazor client-side authentication

In Blazor client-side apps, authentication checks can be bypassed because all client-side code can be modified by users. The same is true for all client-side app technologies, including JavaScript SPA frameworks or native apps for any operating system.

Implementation of a custom `AuthenticationStateProvider` service for Blazor client-side apps is covered in the following sections.

## AuthenticationStateProvider service

Blazor server-side apps include a built-in `AuthenticationStateProvider` service that obtains authentication state data from ASP.NET Core's `HttpContext.User`. This is how authentication state integrates with existing ASP.NET Core server-side authentication mechanisms.

`AuthenticationStateProvider` is the underlying service used by the `AuthorizeView` component and `CascadingAuthenticationState` component to get the authentication state.

You don't typically use `AuthenticationStateProvider` directly. Use the [AuthorizeView component](#authorizeview-component) or [Task<AuthenticationState>](#expose-the-authentication-state-as-a-cascading-parameter) approaches described later in this article. The main drawback to using `AuthenticationStateProvider` directly is that the component isn't notified automatically if the underlying authentication state data changes.

The `AuthenticationStateProvider` service can provide the current user's <xref:System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal> data, as shown in the following example:

```cshtml
@page "/"
@inject AuthenticationStateProvider AuthenticationStateProvider

<button @onclick="@LogUsername">Write user info to console</button>

@code {
    private async Task LogUsername()
    {
        var authState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
        var user = authState.User;

        if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{user.Identity.Name} is authenticated.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The user is NOT authenticated.");
        }
    }
}
```

If `user.Identity.IsAuthenticated` is `true` and because the user is a <xref:System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal>, claims can be enumerated and membership in roles evaluated.

For more information on dependency injection (DI) and services, see <xref:blazor/dependency-injection> and <xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection>.

## Implement a custom AuthenticationStateProvider

If you're building a Blazor client-side app or if your app's specification absolutely requires a custom provider, implement a provider and override `GetAuthenticationStateAsync`:

```csharp
class CustomAuthStateProvider : AuthenticationStateProvider
{
    public override Task<AuthenticationState> GetAuthenticationStateAsync()
    {
        var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(new[]
        {
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "mrfibuli"),
        }, "Fake authentication type");

        var user = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);

        return Task.FromResult(new AuthenticationState(user));
    }
}
```

The `CustomAuthStateProvider` service is registered in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<AuthenticationStateProvider, CustomAuthStateProvider>();
}
```

Using the `CustomAuthStateProvider`, all users are authenticated with the username `mrfibuli`.

## Expose the authentication state as a cascading parameter

If authentication state data is required for procedural logic, such as when performing an action triggered by the user, obtain the authentication state data by defining a cascading parameter of type `Task<AuthenticationState>`:

```cshtml
@page "/"

<button @onclick="@LogUsername">Log username</button>

@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    private Task<AuthenticationState> authenticationStateTask { get; set; }

    private async Task LogUsername()
    {
        var authState = await authenticationStateTask;
        var user = authState.User;

        if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{user.Identity.Name} is authenticated.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The user is NOT authenticated.");
        }
    }
}
```

If `user.Identity.IsAuthenticated` is `true`, claims can be enumerated and membership in roles evaluated.

Set up the `Task<AuthenticationState>` cascading parameter using the `CascadingAuthenticationState` component:

```cshtml
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly="typeof(Startup).Assembly">
        <NotFoundContent>
            <h1>Sorry</h1>
            <p>Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
        </NotFoundContent>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>
```

## Authorization

After a user is authenticated, *authorization* rules are applied to control what the user can do.

Access is typically granted or denied based on whether:

* A user is authenticated (signed in).
* A user is in a *role*.
* A user has a *claim*.
* A *policy* is satisfied.

Each of these concepts is the same as in an ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Pages app. For more information on ASP.NET Core security, see the articles under [ASP.NET Core Security and Identity](xref:security/index).

## AuthorizeView component

The `AuthorizeView` component selectively displays UI depending on whether the user is authorized to see it. This approach is useful when you only need to *display* data for the user and don't need to use the user's identity in procedural logic.

The component exposes a `context` variable of type `AuthenticationState`, which you can use to access information about the signed-in user:

```cshtml
<AuthorizeView>
    <h1>Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!</h1>
    <p>You can only see this content if you're authenticated.</p>
</AuthorizeView>
```

You can also supply different content for display if the user isn't authenticated:

```cshtml
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <h1>Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!</h1>
        <p>You can only see this content if you're authenticated.</p>
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <h1>Authentication Failure!</h1>
        <p>You're not signed in.</p>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

The content of `<Authorized>` and `<NotAuthorized>` can include arbitrary items, such as other interactive components.

Authorization conditions, such as roles or policies that control UI options or access, are covered in the [Authorization](#authorization) section.

If authorization conditions aren't specified, `AuthorizeView` uses a default policy and treats:

* Authenticated (signed-in) users as authorized.
* Unauthenticated (signed-out) users as unauthorized.

### Role-based and policy-based authorization

The `AuthorizeView` component supports *role-based* or *policy-based* authorization.

For role-based authorization, use the `Roles` parameter:

```cshtml
<AuthorizeView Roles="admin, superuser">
    <p>You can only see this if you're an admin or superuser.</p>
</AuthorizeView>
```

For more information, see <xref:security/authorization/roles>.

For policy-based authorization, use the `Policy` parameter:

```cshtml
<AuthorizeView Policy="content-editor">
    <p>You can only see this if you satisfy the "content-editor" policy.</p>
</AuthorizeView>
```

Claims-based authorization is a special case of policy-based authorization. For example, you can define a policy that requires users to have a certain claim. For more information, see <xref:security/authorization/policies>.

These APIs can be used in either Blazor server-side or Blazor client-side apps.

If neither `Roles` nor `Policy` is specified, `AuthorizeView` uses the default policy.

### Content displayed during asynchronous authentication

Blazor allows for authentication state to be determined *asynchronously*. The primary scenario for this approach is in Blazor client-side apps that make a request to an external endpoint for authentication.

While authentication is in progress, `AuthorizeView` displays no content by default. To display content while authentication occurs, use the `<Authorizing>` element:

```cshtml
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <h1>Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!</h1>
        <p>You can only see this content if you're authenticated.</p>
    </Authorized>
    <Authorizing>
        <h1>Authentication in progress</h1>
        <p>You can only see this content while authentication is in progress.</p>
    </Authorizing>
</AuthorizeView>
```

This approach isn't normally applicable to Blazor server-side apps. Blazor server-side apps know the authentication state as soon as the state is established. `Authorizing` content can be provided in a Blazor server-side app's `AuthorizeView` component, but the content is never displayed.

## [Authorize] attribute

Just like an app can use `[Authorize]` with an MVC controller or Razor page, `[Authorize]` can also be used with Razor Components:

```cshtml
@page "/"
@attribute [Authorize]

You can only see this if you're signed in.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only use `[Authorize]` on `@page` components reached via the Blazor Router. Authorization is only performed as an aspect of routing and *not* for child components rendered within a page. To authorize the display of specific parts within a page, use `AuthorizeView` instead.

You may need to add `@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization` either to the component or to the *_Imports.razor* file in order for the component to compile.

The `[Authorize]` attribute also supports role-based or policy-based authorization. For role-based authorization, use the `Roles` parameter:

```cshtml
@page "/"
@attribute [Authorize(Roles = "admin, superuser")]

<p>You can only see this if you're in the 'admin' or 'superuser' role.</p>
```

For policy-based authorization, use the `Policy` parameter:

```cshtml
@page "/"
@attribute [Authorize(Policy = "content-editor")]

<p>You can only see this if you satisfy the 'content-editor' policy.</p>
```

If neither `Roles` nor `Policy` is specified, `[Authorize]` uses the default policy, which by default is to treat:

* Authenticated (signed-in) users as authorized.
* Unauthenticated (signed-out) users as unauthorized.

## Customize unauthorized content with the Router component

The `Router` component allows the app to specify custom content if:

* Content isn't found.
* The user fails an `[Authorize]` condition applied to the component. The `[Authorize]` attribute is covered in the [[Authorize] attribute](#authorize-attribute) section.
* Asynchronous authentication is in progress.

In the default Blazor server-side project template, the *App.razor* file demonstrates how to set custom content:

```cshtml
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly="typeof(Startup).Assembly">
        <NotFoundContent>
            <h1>Sorry</h1>
            <p>Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
        </NotFoundContent>
        <NotAuthorizedContent>
            <h1>Sorry</h1>
            <p>You're not authorized to reach this page.</p>
            <p>You may need to log in as a different user.</p>
        </NotAuthorizedContent>
        <AuthorizingContent>
            <h1>Authentication in progress</h1>
            <p>Only visible while authentication is in progress.</p>
        </AuthorizingContent>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>
```

The content of `<NotFoundContent>`, `<NotAuthorizedContent>`, and `<AuthorizingContent>` can include arbitrary items, such as other interactive components.

If `<NotAuthorizedContent>` isn't specified, the router uses the following fallback message:

```html
Not authorized.
```

## Notification about authentication state changes

If the app determines that the underlying authentication state data has changed (for example, because the user signed out or another user has changed their roles), a custom `AuthenticationStateProvider` can optionally invoke the method `NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged` on the `AuthenticationStateProvider` base class. This notifies consumers of the authentication state data (for example, `AuthorizeView`) to rerender using the new data.

## Procedural logic

If the app is required to check authorization rules as part of procedural logic, use a cascaded parameter of type `Task<AuthenticationState>` to obtain the user's <xref:System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal>. `Task<AuthenticationState>` can be combined with other services, such as `IAuthorizationService`, to evaluate policies.

```cshtml
@inject IAuthorizationService AuthorizationService

<button @onclick="@DoSomething">Do something important</button>

@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    private Task<AuthenticationState> authenticationStateTask { get; set; }

    private async Task DoSomething()
    {
        var user = (await authenticationStateTask).User;

        if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            // Perform an action only available to authenticated (signed-in) users.
        }

        if (user.IsInRole("admin"))
        {
            // Perform an action only available to users in the 'admin' role.
        }

        if ((await AuthorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(user, "content-editor"))
            .Succeeded)
        {
            // Perform an action only available to users satisfying the 
            // 'content-editor' policy.
        }
    }
}
```

## Authorization in Blazor client-side apps

In Blazor client-side apps, authorization checks can be bypassed because all client-side code can be modified by users. The same is true for all client-side app technologies, including JavaScript SPA frameworks or native apps for any operating system.

**Always perform authorization checks on the server within any API endpoints accessed by your client-side app.**

## Troubleshoot errors

Common errors:

* **Authorization requires a cascading parameter of type Task\<AuthenticationState>. Consider using CascadingAuthenticationState to supply this.**

* **`null` value is received for `authenticationStateTask`**

It's likely that the project wasn't created using a Blazor server-side template with authentication enabled. Wrap a `<CascadingAuthenticationState>` around some part of the UI tree, for example in *App.razor* as follows:

```cshtml
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly="typeof(Startup).Assembly">
        ...
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>
```

The `CascadingAuthenticationState` supplies the `Task<AuthenticationState>` cascading parameter, which in turn it receives from the underlying `AuthenticationStateProvider` DI service.
