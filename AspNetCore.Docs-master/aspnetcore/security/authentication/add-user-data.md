# Add, download, and delete custom user data to Identity in an ASP.NET Core project

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

This article shows how to:

* Add custom user data to an ASP.NET Core web app.
* Decorate the custom user data model with the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.PersonalDataAttribute> attribute so it's automatically available for download and deletion. Making the data able to be downloaded and deleted helps meet [GDPR](xref:security/gdpr) requirements.

The project sample is created from a Razor Pages web app, but the instructions are similar for a ASP.NET Core MVC web app.

[View or download sample code](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/security/authentication/add-user-data) ([how to download](xref:index#how-to-download-a-sample))

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [](~/includes/2.2-SDK.md)]

## Create a Razor web app

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* From the Visual Studio **File** menu, select **New** > **Project**. Name the project **WebApp1** if you want to it match the namespace of the [download sample](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/live/aspnetcore/security/authentication/add-user-data) code.
* Select **ASP.NET Core Web Application** > **OK**
* Select **ASP.NET Core 2.2** in the dropdown
* Select **Web Application**  > **OK**
* Build and run the project.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

```cli
dotnet new webapp -o WebApp1
```

---

## Run the Identity scaffolder

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* From **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the project > **Add** > **New Scaffolded Item**.
* From the left pane of the **Add Scaffold** dialog, select **Identity** > **ADD**.
* In the **ADD Identity** dialog, the following options:
  * Select the existing layout  file  *~/Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml*
  * Select the following files to override:
    * **Account/Register**
    * **Account/Manage/Index**
  * Select the **+** button to create a new **Data context class**. Accept the type (**WebApp1.Models.WebApp1Context** if the project is named **WebApp1**).
  * Select the **+** button to create a new **User class**. Accept the type (**WebApp1User** if the project is named **WebApp1**) > **Add**.
* Select **ADD**.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

If you have not previously installed the ASP.NET Core scaffolder, install it now:

```cli
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator
```

Add a package reference to [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design/) to the project (.csproj) file. Run the following command in the project directory:

```cli
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet restore
```

Run the following command to list the Identity scaffolder options:

```cli
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -h
```

In the project folder, run the Identity scaffolder:

```cli
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -u WebApp1User -fi Account.Register;Account.Manage.Index
```

---

Follow the instruction in [Migrations, UseAuthentication, and layout](xref:security/authentication/scaffold-identity#efm) to perform the following steps:

* Create a migration and update the database.
* Add `UseAuthentication` to `Startup.Configure`.
* Add `<partial name="_LoginPartial" />` to the layout file.
* Test the app:
  * Register a user
  * Select the new user name (next to the **Logout** link). You might need to expand the window or select the navigation bar icon to show the user name and other links.
  * Select the **Personal Data** tab.
  * Select the **Download** button and examined the *PersonalData.json* file.
  * Test the **Delete** button, which deletes the logged on user.

## Add custom user data to the Identity DB

Update the `IdentityUser` derived class with custom properties. If you named the project WebApp1, the file is named *Areas/Identity/Data/WebApp1User.cs*. Update the file with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](add-user-data/sample-2.2/Areas/Identity/Data/WebApp1User.cs)]

Properties decorated with the [PersonalData](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.personaldataattribute?view=aspnetcore-2.1) attribute are:

* Deleted when the *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/DeletePersonalData.cshtml* Razor Page calls `UserManager.Delete`.
* Included in the downloaded data by the *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/DownloadPersonalData.cshtml* Razor Page.

### Update the Account/Manage/Index.cshtml page

Update the `InputModel` in *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/Index.cshtml.cs* with the following highlighted code:

[!code-csharp[Main](add-user-data/sample-2.2/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet&highlight=28-36,63-64,98-106,119)]

Update the *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/Index.cshtml* with the following highlighted markup:

[!code-html[Main](add-user-data/sample-2.2/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/Index.cshtml?highlight=35-42)]

### Update the Account/Register.cshtml page

Update the `InputModel` in *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs* with the following highlighted code:

[!code-csharp[Main](add-user-data/sample-2.2/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs?name=snippet&highlight=28-36,67,66)]

Update the *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml* with the following highlighted markup:

[!code-html[Main](add-user-data/sample-2.2/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml?highlight=16-25)]

Build the project.

### Add a migration for the custom user data

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

In the Visual Studio **Package Manager Console**:

```PMC
Add-Migration CustomUserData
Update-Database
```

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

```cli
dotnet ef migrations add CustomUserData
dotnet ef database update
```

---

## Test create, view, download, delete custom user data

Test the app:

* Register a new user.
* View the custom user data on the `/Identity/Account/Manage` page.
* Download and view the users personal data from the `/Identity/Account/Manage/PersonalData` page.
