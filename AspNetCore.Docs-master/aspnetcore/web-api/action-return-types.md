ASP.NET Core offers the following options for Web API controller action return types:

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

* [Specific type](#specific-type)
* [IActionResult](#iactionresult-type)
* [ActionResult\<T>](#actionresultt-type)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= aspnetcore-2.0"

* [Specific type](#specific-type)
* [IActionResult](#iactionresult-type)

::: moniker-end

This document explains when it's most appropriate to use each return type.

## Specific type

The simplest action returns a primitive or complex data type (for example, `string` or a custom object type). Consider the following action, which returns a collection of custom `Product` objects:

[!code-csharp[](../web-api/action-return-types/samples/WebApiSample.Api.21/Controllers/ProductsController.cs?name=snippet_Get)]

Without known conditions to safeguard against during action execution, returning a specific type could suffice. The preceding action accepts no parameters, so parameter constraints validation isn't needed.

When known conditions need to be accounted for in an action, multiple return paths are introduced. In such a case, it's common to mix an [ActionResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.actionresult) return type with the primitive or complex return type. Either [IActionResult](#iactionresult-type) or [ActionResult\<T>](#actionresultt-type) are necessary to accommodate this type of action.

## IActionResult type

The [IActionResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.iactionresult) return type is appropriate when multiple [ActionResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.actionresult) return types are possible in an action. The `ActionResult` types represent various HTTP status codes. Some common return types falling into this category are [BadRequestResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.badrequestresult) (400), [NotFoundResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.notfoundresult) (404), and [OkObjectResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.okobjectresult) (200).

Because there are multiple return types and paths in the action, liberal use of the [[ProducesResponseType]](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.producesresponsetypeattribute.-ctor) attribute is necessary. This attribute produces more descriptive response details for API help pages generated by tools like [Swagger](/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger). `[ProducesResponseType]` indicates the known types and HTTP status codes to be returned by the action.

### Synchronous action

Consider the following synchronous action in which there are two possible return types:

[!code-csharp[](../web-api/action-return-types/samples/WebApiSample.Api.Pre21/Controllers/ProductsController.cs?name=snippet_GetById&highlight=8,11)]

In the preceding action, a 404 status code is returned when the product represented by `id` doesn't exist in the underlying data store. The [NotFound](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase.notfound) helper method is invoked as a shortcut to `return new NotFoundResult();`. If the product does exist, a `Product` object representing the payload is returned with a 200 status code. The [Ok](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase.ok) helper method is invoked as the shorthand form of `return new OkObjectResult(product);`.

### Asynchronous action

Consider the following asynchronous action in which there are two possible return types:

[!code-csharp[](../web-api/action-return-types/samples/WebApiSample.Api.Pre21/Controllers/ProductsController.cs?name=snippet_CreateAsync&highlight=8,13)]

In the preceding code:

* A 400 status code ([BadRequest](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase.BadRequest*)) is returned by the ASP.NET Core runtime when the product description contains "XYZ Widget".
* A 201 status code is generated by the [CreatedAtAction](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase.CreatedAtAction*) method when a product is created. In this code path, the `Product` object is returned.

For example, the following model indicates that requests must include the `Name` and `Description` properties. Therefore, failure to provide `Name` and `Description` in the request causes model validation to fail.

[!code-csharp[](../web-api/action-return-types/samples/WebApiSample.DataAccess/Models/Product.cs?name=snippet_ProductClass&highlight=5-6,8-9)]

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

If the [[ApiController]](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiControllerAttribute) attribute in ASP.NET Core 2.1 or later  is applied, model validation errors result in a 400 status code. For more information, see [Automatic HTTP 400 responses](xref:web-api/index#automatic-http-400-responses).

## ActionResult\<T> type

ASP.NET Core 2.1 introduces the [ActionResult\<T>](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.actionresult-1) return type for Web API controller actions. It enables you to return a type deriving from [ActionResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.actionresult) or return a [specific type](#specific-type). `ActionResult<T>` offers the following benefits over the [IActionResult type](#iactionresult-type):

* The [[ProducesResponseType]](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.producesresponsetypeattribute) attribute's `Type` property can be excluded. For example, `[ProducesResponseType(200, Type = typeof(Product))]` is simplified to `[ProducesResponseType(200)]`. The action's expected return type is instead inferred from the `T` in `ActionResult<T>`.
* [Implicit cast operators](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/implicit) support the conversion of both `T` and `ActionResult` to `ActionResult<T>`. `T` converts to [ObjectResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.objectresult), which means `return new ObjectResult(T);` is simplified to `return T;`.

C# doesn't support implicit cast operators on interfaces. Consequently, conversion of the interface to a concrete type is necessary to use `ActionResult<T>`. For example, use of `IEnumerable` in the following example doesn't work:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Product>> Get()
{
    return _repository.GetProducts();
}
```

One option to fix the preceding code is to return `_repository.GetProducts().ToList();`.

Most actions have a specific return type. Unexpected conditions can occur during action execution, in which case the specific type isn't returned. For example, an action's input parameter may fail model validation. In such a case, it's common to return the appropriate `ActionResult` type instead of the specific type.

### Synchronous action

Consider a synchronous action in which there are two possible return types:

[!code-csharp[](../web-api/action-return-types/samples/WebApiSample.Api.21/Controllers/ProductsController.cs?name=snippet_GetById&highlight=7,10)]

In the preceding code, a 404 status code is returned when the product doesn't exist in the database. If the product does exist, the corresponding `Product` object is returned. Before ASP.NET Core 2.1, the `return product;` line would have been `return Ok(product);`.

> [!TIP]
> As of ASP.NET Core 2.1, action parameter binding source inference is enabled when a controller class is decorated with the `[ApiController]` attribute. A parameter name matching a name in the route template is automatically bound using the request route data. Consequently, the preceding action's `id` parameter isn't explicitly annotated with the [[FromRoute]](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.fromrouteattribute) attribute.

### Asynchronous action

Consider an asynchronous action in which there are two possible return types:

[!code-csharp[](../web-api/action-return-types/samples/WebApiSample.Api.21/Controllers/ProductsController.cs?name=snippet_CreateAsync&highlight=8,13)]

In the preceding code:

* A 400 status code ([BadRequest](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase.BadRequest*)) is returned by the ASP.NET Core runtime when:
  * The [[ApiController]](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiControllerAttribute) attribute has been applied and model validation fails.
  * The product description contains "XYZ Widget".
* A 201 status code is generated by the [CreatedAtAction](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase.CreatedAtAction*) method when a product is created. In this code path, the `Product` object is returned.

> [!TIP]
> As of ASP.NET Core 2.1, action parameter binding source inference is enabled when a controller class is decorated with the `[ApiController]` attribute. Complex type parameters are automatically bound using the request body. Consequently, the preceding action's `product` parameter isn't explicitly annotated with the [[FromBody]](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.frombodyattribute) attribute.
