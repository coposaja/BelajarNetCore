# Differences between ASP.NET SignalR and ASP.NET Core SignalR

ASP.NET Core SignalR isn't compatible with clients or servers for ASP.NET SignalR. This article details features which have been removed or changed in ASP.NET Core SignalR.

## How to identify the SignalR version

|                      | ASP.NET SignalR | ASP.NET Core SignalR |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Server NuGet Package | [Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR/) | [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App/) (.NET Core)<br>[Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR/) (.NET Framework) |
| Client NuGet Packages | [Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Client/)<br>[Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.JS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.JS/) | [Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client/) |
| Client npm Package | [signalr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalr) | [@aspnet/signalr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aspnet/signalr) |
| Java Client | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SignalR/java-client) (deprecated)  | Maven package [com.microsoft.signalr](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.signalr/signalr) |
| Server App Type | ASP.NET (System.Web) or OWIN Self-Host | ASP.NET Core |
| Supported Server Platforms | .NET Framework 4.5 or later | .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later<br>.NET Core 2.1 or later |

## Feature differences

### Automatic reconnects

Automatic reconnects aren't supported in ASP.NET Core SignalR. If the client is disconnected, the user must explicitly start a new connection if they want to reconnect. In ASP.NET SignalR, SignalR attempts to reconnect to the server if the connection is dropped. 

### Protocol support

ASP.NET Core SignalR supports JSON, as well as a new binary protocol based on [MessagePack](xref:signalr/messagepackhubprotocol). Additionally, custom protocols can be created.

### Transports

The Forever Frame transport is not supported in ASP.NET Core SignalR.

## Differences on the server

The ASP.NET Core SignalR server-side libraries are included in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage-app) package that's part of the **ASP.NET Core Web Application** template for both Razor and MVC projects.

ASP.NET Core SignalR is an ASP.NET Core middleware, so it must be configured by calling [AddSignalR](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.signalrdependencyinjectionextensions.addsignalr) in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.

```csharp
services.AddSignalR()
```

To configure routing, map routes to hubs inside the [UseSignalR](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.signalrappbuilderextensions.usesignalr) method call in the `Startup.Configure` method.

```csharp
app.UseSignalR(routes =>
{
    routes.MapHub<ChatHub>("/hub");
});
```

### Sticky sessions

The scaleout model for ASP.NET SignalR allows clients to reconnect and send messages to any server in the farm. In ASP.NET Core SignalR, the client must interact with the same server for the duration of the connection. For scaleout using Redis, that means sticky sessions are required. For scaleout using [Azure SignalR Service](/azure/azure-signalr/), sticky sessions are not required because the service handles connections to clients. 

### Single hub per connection

In ASP.NET Core SignalR, the connection model has been simplified. Connections are made directly to a single hub, rather than a single connection being used to share access to multiple hubs.

### Streaming

ASP.NET Core SignalR now supports [streaming data](xref:signalr/streaming) from the hub to the client.

### State

The ability to pass arbitrary state between clients and the hub (often called HubState) has been removed, as well as support for progress messages. There is no counterpart of hub proxies at the moment.

### PersistentConnection removal

In ASP.NET Core SignalR, the [PersistentConnection](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/aspnet/jj919047(v%3dvs.118)) class has been removed. 

### GlobalHost

ASP.NET Core has dependency injection (DI) built into the framework. Services can use DI to access the [HubContext](xref:signalr/hubcontext). The `GlobalHost` object that is used in ASP.NET SignalR to get a `HubContext` doesn't exist in ASP.NET Core SignalR.

### HubPipeline

ASP.NET Core SignalR doesn't have support for `HubPipeline` modules.

## Differences on the client

### TypeScript

The ASP.NET Core SignalR client is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You can write in JavaScript or TypeScript when using the [JavaScript client](xref:signalr/javascript-client).

### The JavaScript client is hosted at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

In previous versions, the JavaScript client was obtained through a NuGet package in Visual Studio. For the Core versions, the [@aspnet/signalr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aspnet/signalr) npm package contains the JavaScript libraries. This package isn't included in the **ASP.NET Core Web Application** template. Use npm to obtain and install the `@aspnet/signalr` npm package.

```console
npm init -y
npm install @aspnet/signalr
```

### jQuery

The dependency on jQuery has been removed, however projects can still use jQuery.

### Internet Explorer support

ASP.NET Core SignalR requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 or later (ASP.NET SignalR supported Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and later).

### JavaScript client method syntax

The JavaScript syntax has changed from the previous version of SignalR. Rather than using the `$connection` object, create a connection using the [HubConnectionBuilder](/javascript/api/%40aspnet/signalr/hubconnectionbuilder) API.

```javascript
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/hub")
    .build();
```

Use the [on](/javascript/api/@aspnet/signalr/HubConnection#on) method to specify client methods that the hub can call.

```javascript
connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) => {
    const msg = message.replace(/&/g, "&amp;").replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
    const encodedMsg = user + " says " + msg;
    log(encodedMsg);
});
```

After creating the client method, start the hub connection. Chain a [catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch) method to log or handle errors.

```javascript
connection.start().catch(err => console.error(err.toString()));
```

### Hub proxies

Hub proxies are no longer automatically generated. Instead, the method name is passed into the [invoke](/javascript/api/%40aspnet/signalr/hubconnection#invoke) API as a string.

### .NET and other clients

The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client` NuGet package contains the .NET client libraries for ASP.NET Core SignalR.

Use the [HubConnectionBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.client.hubconnectionbuilder) to create and build an instance of a connection to a hub.

```csharp
connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
    .WithUrl("url")
    .Build();
```

## Scaleout differences

ASP.NET SignalR supports SQL Server and Redis. ASP.NET Core SignalR supports Azure SignalR Service and Redis.
